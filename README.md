# Stickman The Flash
This is the my intern project done in June 2024 as a game developer. <br>
I was assigned to make a replica of existing game with the same name. It was made using C# with Unity Editor and Visual Studio Code. The animation was given to me by the senior developers, and it was Spine 2D.
